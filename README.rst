The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display
more details about the panel's content.

Here's a screenshot of the toolbar in action:

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

The current stable version of the Debug Toolbar is 5.0.1. It works on
Django ≥ 4.2.0.

The Debug Toolbar has experimental support for `Django's asynchronous views
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/async/>`_. Please note that
the Debug Toolbar still lacks the capability for handling concurrent requests.
If you find any issues, please report them on the `issue tracker`_.

Documentation, including installation and configuration instructions, is
available at https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/.

The Django Debug Toolbar is released under the BSD license, like Django
itself. If you like it, please consider contributing!

The Django Debug Toolbar was originally created by Rob Hudson <rob@cogit8.org>
in August 2008 and was further developed by many contributors_.
